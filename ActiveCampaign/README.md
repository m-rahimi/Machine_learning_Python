This repository contains my solution to the assignment that I got from ActiveCampaign 

Given the time series attached, use any programming language of choice to:

- Describe the statistical process in a free creative form (include outliers, misfits, patterns etc.);
- What existing stat models that you know or can research (or a combination of) are best fit to predict processes of this type and why?
- Can you derive any reliable sequencing probabilities in this data e.g. if (i-3>0 and i-2<0 and i-1>0) then i>0)? (optional but a big plus)
