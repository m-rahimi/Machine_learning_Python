Zillow’s Zestimate is a well-known framework for home value prediction using machine learning models. Zillow has challenged the data science community to improve the accuracy of Zestimate through a $1,200,000 competition. The competition has been administrated by Kaggle, and the object of the competition was to predict the Zestimate’s residual error. I implemented an Extreme Gradient Boosting model to predict the Zestimate’s residual error and used cross-validation method for evaluation. To improve the predictive model, I applied an iterative process between feature engineering and evaluation. Using appropriate visualizations and statistical techniques, I uncovered the relationship between the target variable and features that led to an effective feature engineering. Then, I developed an ensemble of multiple models (such as Xgboost, Lightgbm, and Random forest) to further improve the accuracy of my model. I completed the competition in rank 14 on the leaderboard among 3780 teams.
